# Cryptanalyses
Find weaknesses in a cipher. at its most basic it is cipher text only, given cipher text only find the key or plain text.
Known plain text attack. Using the plain and cipher can you find the key?
Linear cryptanalysis and diff cryptanalysis the attacker chooses the plain text.
differential, keep changing the input to see if you can reverse engineer the key.
# Steganography
not cryptography this is hiding data. Great way to provide plausibility of saying there is no hidden message when combined with cryptography.
Input -> secrete algorithm -> output. 
# Kerchoffs Principle
Security of encryption should come from eseecrete key
