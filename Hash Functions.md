Also called one way functions. Fundamentally true one way functions cannot be proved even if they cannot prove a duplicate exists
A function that takes a variable input runs it through a deterministic and creates a fixed data output. This is not reversable because the output is smaller than output. Fundamentally multiple inputs can map to the same output. In crypto this is a problem. An additional problem is that the hash functions can be reversed, the output can never represent the input.

# RSA

# MD5
Most common hash function is MD5, invented by Rivest. There have been other versions but they all had issues and they kept being fixed culminating in MD5, today MD5 is known to be broken and has been replaced [[#SHA]], secure hash algorithm.
