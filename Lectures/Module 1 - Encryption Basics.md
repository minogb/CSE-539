# History
## Ceaser cipher
is most likely the first know encryption method, from around 50bc. The alphabet is shifted by X number of character in the alphabet ie A->C is a 2 shift. The key is number of shifts.
Can be broken with brute force, at most 25 attempts.
letter frequency analysis, in English the most common letter is e. if you can find what letter is you can you find the key.
Monoalphabetic cypher, one letter is always transalated to another.
## Vigenere cipher
invented in 1553.
Take a plaintext, you take your key and use the key and input as a two axis lookup. The key is repeated to match the input.
Difficult to brute force.
Polyalphabetic cypher, one letter is not always translated to another.
Kasiski in 1863 figured out how to break it. Certain pairs of characters in cipher text. If xy is appears multiple time in the output, the length of the difference is the length of the key or a multiple. once one letter is identified the output is simply ceaser cipher.
