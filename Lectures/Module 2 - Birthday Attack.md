If there are 23 people in a room, two people may have the same birthday, 50% of the time.
The more numbers are picked the more likely duplicates are created. This does not increases the chance of picking a chosen number twice.
Failure point should be calculated at about 50% chance not 100%
Effects hash functions. about the sqrt of N.
Given one value find another value with the same hash. This is about 2^n
Given two values find any pair of values that have the same hash. This is about 2^(n/2)

minimum of 256 to create a 128 bit strong hash to avoid this attack.
